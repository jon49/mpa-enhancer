# MPA Enhancer

Minimalist JavaScript to make your MPA work that much better

On reloading of a page will scroll back to where the user left off and focus on
the last element they were looking at.

Under 1 kB of minified JavaScript.

[Example TODO MVC application.](https://jon49.github.io/mpa-enhancer/todo/)
